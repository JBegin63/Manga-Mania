# Manga-Mania

This is the Solo Project for CodingDojo's Project and Algorithm's track. I decided to incorporate something I liked into my project so I decided to make a manga
social media site, something where people can go to talk about them and rate them. MyAnimeList (MAL) already does this but it's mainly just a site for rating
anime, not neccissarily for open discussions about them. This is still a work in progress with things like the comments still being figured out, I'd consider it 
'completed' with stuff like a search bar, manga rankedin order, filtering manga or comments to show liked manga or comments about those manga, being able to view the site while not being logged in like you can on twitter.
